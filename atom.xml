        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>People who believe in luck and bad luck -- that is to say, those considered superstitious – may think that some days or events are unlucky.</p>
<p>In the United States, Friday the 13 is known as an “unlucky” day by superstitious people. Another famously unlucky day for some is March 15, also known as, “The Ides of March.”</p>
<p>The Ides of March is so unlucky that it is often spoken as a warning: “Beware the Ides of March.”</p>
<p>First, what exactly is an “ides?” The Latin root of “ides,” a singular word, means “to divide.” So, the ides of any month falls in its middle. The Roman calendar set ides on the 15th in March, May, July and October or on the 13th in the other months. The ides of a month usually falls on the first day of a full moon.</p>
<p>In Roman times, the Ides of March was known as a date for paying off debts. But this connection was quickly lost because of different timing between calendar months and changes in the moon’s appearance. The Ides of March was also a time people celebrated Mars, the god of war.</p>
<p>But why do some people still use the expression, &quot;Beware of the Ides of March&quot;? Why do they consider it an unlucky day?</p>
<p>March 15 was very unlucky for one man a very long time ago. On that date in the year 44 BC Julius Caesar was killed.<br>
The British playwright William Shakespeare takes this incident from Roman history and freezes it forever in literature. In Act 1, Scene 2 of &quot;Julius And Brutus, Caesar’s loyal friend answers, “A soothsayer says to (bids you) beware the Ides of March.</p>
<p>Caesar does not listen to the warning. He should have. In Act III, Scene I, Shakespeare’s famous line seems to show that Caesar is asking for trouble.</p>
<p>Caesar says to the Soothsayer, “The Ides of March are come.”</p>
<p>The Soothsayer answers, “Aye, Caesar, but not gone.”</p>
<p>Caesar’s friend Brutus will be among the attackers who kill him on the Ides of March.</p>
<p>When he sees that Brutus has turned against him, he says, “Eh tu, Brutus?” This means “You too, Brutus?”</p>
<p>This expression is widely used in Western culture when someone is betrayed by a friend.Caesar,” Shakespeare writes about a meeting between the dictator and a “soothsayer,” someone who can predict the future.</p>
<p>“Beware the Ides of March,” says the soothsayer.</p>
<p>Caesar asks, “What man is that?”<br>
The Ides of March” is also the name of a U.S. film made in 2011. George Clooney directed the film. He also stars in it as a promising presidential candidate.</p>
<p>While no one gets assassinated, “The Ides of March” is a film abo________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Words in This Story<br>
beware – v. to be on guard; to take care of</p>
<p>aye – adv. yes; a word of confirmation</p>
<p>assassinate – v. to murder someone, often for political reasonsut a friend being disloyal to a friend in the world of politics. Often in politics, loyalty and friendship do not go hand-in-hand.</p>
<p>Julius Caesar learned this the hard way on the Ides of March.</p>

<p>In 1872, a Nebraska man named J. Sterling Morton proposed the first Arbor Day. It became a legal holiday in the state 13 years later.</p>
<p>Today many states observe Arbor Day on different dates throughout the year based on best planting times in their area. In North Dakota and Vermont, for example, Arbor Day is celebrated on the first Friday in May.</p>
<p>A non-profit group called the Arbor Day Foundation operates the ArborDay.org website. It notes that “tree planting festivals are as old as civilization. The tree has appeared throughout history and literature as the symbol of life.”</p>
<p>Trees do a lot for the environment. They clean the air around us. Some trees, such as apple and pear, give us fruit. Trees also provide shade for us and other creatures.</p>
<p>Some animals build their homes inside trees or on strong tree branches. People and animals can use the wood from trees for building materials.</p>
<p>You might find this strange, but trees can be fun to watch. You can just sit back and watch birds high up in the trees. If you live in an area with squirrels, watching them run up and around trees, jumping from one to the next can be a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Dogs bark a lot. They bark when they want to go outside for a walk. They bark with they see other dogs. They bark when they chase other animals, such as cats and squirrels.</p>
<p>Now, imagine that a dog chases a squirrel up a tree. That is a lot of work – for the dog, that is. Dogs cannot climb trees. Squirrels, on the other hand, are expert climbers -- of trees and just about anything else. A squirrel may go up one tree but then jump to another. The dog simply can’t follow the squirrel. So, it stays on the ground barking and barking up the wrong tree.</p>
<p>And that is where we get our idiom.</p>
<p>When a dog barks up a wrong tree, they are barking up a tree that no longer has their prey – the squirrel.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>For people, barking up the wrong tree means following a mistaken plan of action. If I bark up the wrong tree, I am doing something that will not get the result I want. I am wrong about the reason for something or possibly the way to get something.</p>
<p>For example, at a party I notice that my co-worker Jonas is interested in a good friend of mine named Ursula. But Ursula is happily married, which is bad news for Jonas. So, I say to him, “Jonas, I know you want to ask Ursula out on a date. But you are barking up the wrong tree! She is very happily married.”</p>
<p>Now, let me tell you about another person who used the wrong way to get something.</p>
<p>A friend of mine, Sharon, needed money for her new business idea. So, she went to an event to meet possible investors. However, the only people she met were other people looking for money. She spent the whole time barking up the wrong tree!</p>
<p>Now, keep this in mind when using this expression. While Americans do say “bark up the wrong tree,” we would not say “bark up the right tree.”</p>
<p>So, if you came to the VOA Learning English website to learn English, I would not say you are barking up the right tree. I would just say, “Welcome! You’ve come to the right place!”</p>
<p>Join us again next week when we explore words and expressions in American English.</p>

Sometimes in life, you need to act quickly. Thinking too much about a problem does not always help. It can hold us back.
<p>We have expressions that describe this way of thinking.</p>
<p>“No time like the present.”<br>
“A rolling stone gathers no moss.”<br>
“Just do it!”<br>
But sometimes slower is better.</p>
<p>Many things in life require careful thought and preparation. Sometimes we need to be cautious and take precautions.</p>
<p>A great expression for that kind of behavior is, “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”</p>
<p>This saying comes to us from Benjamin Franklin. In addition to being a writer, Franklin was a printer, political thinker, politician, scientist, inventor and diplomat. He was also one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.</p>
<p>So, he was a busy man. But Franklin still found time to write and offer his advice to others. If he were alive today, he could probably make a good living as a life coach.</p>
<p>“An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,” is one of his most famous sayings. Now, Franklin lived during the 1700s, before the metric system took effect in Europe. The word ounce means something really small – just two one-hundredths of a kilogram to be exact.</p>
<p>So, his expression meant that, when dealing with a problem, spending a small amount of time and effort early on is a good investment. It can save you more trouble in the end.</p>
<p>For example, if a country announces strong measures for containing a virus, we could say, “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”</p>
<p>It is better to take severe precautions than to suffer severe consequences later.</p>
<p>Word historians say that when Franklin first used this expression, he was not talking about disease but rather fire prevention.</p>
<p>During a visit to Boston in 1733, Franklin was impressed with the city’s fire prevention methods. He tried to bring some of these practices to the city of Philadelphia, where he lived.</p>
<p>Supposedly, Franklin sent an unsigned letter to his own newspaper The Pennsylvania Gazette. Published on February 4, 1735, his letter -- “Protection of Towns from Fire” -- began with the expression “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” Then he wrote about how a city should prepare itself for a fire.</p>
<p>From protecting yourself against sickness to preventing a house fire, this expression can be used in serious situations. It is a fixed expression, meaning we don’t change the wording when we use it. We simply repeat it as is.</p>
<p>Let’s listen to this example:</p>
<p>How is the deal going with your real estate agent? Are you ready to buy your new house?</p>
<p>Just about. I have a few more questions about home insurance. So, I’m meeting with a financial advisor and an insurance agent this week.</p>
<p>They are sure to give you a lot of information. Do you really think it’s necessary?</p>
<p>An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If I get anything wrong, it will be difficult to fix later on. And it will cost more, too!</p>
<p>Didn’t you lose a lot of money on repairs to your house because it was under-insured?</p>
<p>Um … Good point. Let’s change the subject!</p>
<p>Now, another way to say this expression is “Better safe than sorry.” We use this one for many different situations – serious and not so serious.</p>
<p>Let's listen to this dialogue.</p>
<p>What a great day to be at the park! Thanks for the invite!</p>
<p>Sure thing. The weather is great! So, why did you bring an umbrella?</p>
<p>Well, the weather forecast said it could rain later today.</p>
<p>I heard that too. But look -- there’s not a cloud in the sky!</p>
<p>Oh, no! You cannot be serious!</p>
<p>Quick! Come under my umbrella! See. Better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>Okay, okay! Good point. Now, let’s get out of this rain.</p>
<p>Here it is better to say “better safe than sorry.” Benjamin Franklin’s advice would have sounded a little too serious.</p>
<p>And that’s the end of this Words and Their Stories!</p>
<p>The next time you want to take care and avoid problems down the road … use the expressions you heard here.</p>
<p>Until next time … I’m Anna Matteo!</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Audio src: https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/where-quarantine-comes-from/5357370.html<br>
In human history, the spread of infectious diseases to mass numbers of people is not uncommon. Pandemics, historians say, started when we humans began farming land and living in communities. Pandemics increased as trade between communities and nations increased.</p>
<p>From smallpox to influenza to the plague, there was often no medical treatment to prevent or cure these diseases. Take for example, the plague that hit Europe in the 14th century. It is also known as the “Black Death.”</p>
<p>With no medical prevention available, isolating the sick was the only effective public health defense. With many other pandemics, the best chance at prevention was to keep sick people away from healthy people. This is called a quarantine.</p>
<p>And that is our word for today.</p>
<p>Word experts at Merriam-Webster explain that the word “quarantine” has both French and Italian influences.</p>
<p>In the late 1400s, English speakers borrowed the French word quarantaine which means “a period of about 40 days.” Quarante is the word for the number 40 (forty) in French.</p>
<p>At that time, quarantaine had a religious meaning. Some word experts say it refers to the period of time Jesus spent fasting -- going without food -- in the desert.</p>
<p>However, over time, people began using it for more than just religious situations. For example, it referred to the delay of putting a legal agreement in place. In the early 1500s, quarantine also was used to describe a &quot;period of 40 days in which a widow has the right to remain in her dead husband's house.”</p>
<p>Around the same time, other city-states in Europe were also using a similar word -- quarantena. This word was used to mean the “isolation of a ship to protect the port city from potential disease.”</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explains on its website that “quarantine was first introduced in 1377 on Croatia’s Dalmatian Coast.”</p>
<p>By the 1600s, English speakers began using quarantena to mean “isolation as protection from disease.” As the French form of this word (quarantaine) was already being used, English kept it but gave it a new meaning. It was now an English word based on French spelling -- with an Italian definition and Latin roots.</p>
<p>In North America in the late 1600s, quarantine was introduced to control yellow fever. The CDC says this was the case in New York (1688) and in Boston (1691).</p>
<p>That’s the word history. Now, let’s talk about how to use “quarantine” in a sentence.</p>
<p>For starters, it is both a noun and a verb.</p>
<p>As a noun, we often use it after the preposition “under.” If someone is under quarantine, they are required to physically keep away from others. For example: “When she was under quarantine, the woman learned how to play the piano and speak simple Russian.”</p>
<p>The word “quarantine” is often combined with other nouns. In the news and from government announcements you may read about, quarantine guidelines, quarantine authority and quarantine systems.</p>
<p>As a verb, we can say that some young people in the United States are not fully self-quarantining themselves.</p>
<p>So, isolation and quarantine are both ways to help protect the public. They both prevent exposure to people who have or may have a contagious disease.</p>

<p>Part1<br>
翻译原文：<br>
-孩子们  这是  张嘴  -不要<br>
在那一刻  勒奈特做了一个决定<br>
想要对付她的孩子们<br>
不能再依靠药物了<br>
当然  随着她的挫败感不断加深<br>
勒奈特认为自我治疗<br>
也无伤大雅<br>
你打算怎么办<br>
永远都不跟我说话了吗<br>
差不多<br>
我想我欠你一个道歉<br>
是么  我可不想让你逼自己<br>
关于你父亲  我不应该说谎<br>
你们不是小孩了  我应该告诉你们真相<br>
对不起<br>
<My Answer><br>
Guys,what's this? open up ur mouth; Nope<br>
Lenate made a decision at that moment<br>
Cannot rely on drugs to deal with her kids<br>
Of course,as her feeling about losing herself and defeated was deepening,<br>
Lenate thought self-treatment was also not a shame<br>
what you intend to do? Never talking with me?<br>
I think you own me an apology to be exact<br>
is it? I don't want you to force yorself<br>
I should't lie ,about your dad<br>
I'd tell you the truth,you are not kid any more<br>
sorry!<br>
<Anwer><br>
Guys, this is a... guys, here... - Nope.<br>
In that moment, Lynette made a decision.<br>
When it came to dealing with her children,<br>
medication was no longer an option.<br>
Of course, given her continuing level of frustration,<br>
Lynette also felt a little<br>
self-medication couldn't hurt.<br>
So what's your strategy?<br>
Are you just never gonna speak to me again?<br>
Something like that.<br>
I suppose I do owe you an apology.<br>
Careful. I wouldn't want you to strain yourself.<br>
I shouldn't have lied to you about your father.<br>
You two are old enough to handle the truth<br>
and I'm sorry.</p>

<p>Part2<br>
读完一本书原文：<br>
Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, “It’s bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.”<br>
It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn’t simply open on to the heavens.<br>
Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard’s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn’t have let it in the house.<br>
Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth — and the hat began to sing:<br>
<My Answer><br>
哈利抬头看去，看见了星星点缀的软绵棉的天花板，主要是为了躲避盯着他的眼睛。他听见赫敏低语道，‘外面的天空使人着迷，我在Hogwarts读过，一段历史’。实在是让人难以相信那里有一块天花板，并且华丽的长廊不仅仅在天空中打开。<br>
当MC教授静静地放了一个四角凳在一年级新生前，哈利迅速的朝下看去。在凳子上他放了一个指向的男巫的帽子。这个帽子是补丁，磨损而且特别脏。P阿姨根本不会让它呆在这个房间的。<br>
或许他们应该试着变一个兔子出来，哈利yy着，似乎就是这类事情。--注意到大厅里的每个人正盯着这个帽子，他也盯着。几秒后陷入了沉寂。然后帽子晃动了，帽子边缘开了一个嘴巴大的裂口--并且帽子开始歌唱<br>
<Anwer><br>
哈利为避开他们的目光，抬头朝上看，只见天鹅绒般漆黑的顶棚上点点星光闪烁。他听见赫敏小声说：“这里施过法术，看起来跟外边的天空一样，我在《霍格沃茨，一段校史》里读到过。”</p>
<p>很难令人相信那上边真有天花板，也很难令人相信餐厅屋顶不是露天的。</p>
<p>麦格教授往一年级新生面前轻轻放了一只四脚凳，哈利连忙收回了目光。麦格教授又往凳子上放了一顶尖顶巫师帽。帽子打着补丁，磨得很旧，而且脏极了。佩妮姨妈决不会让这样的东西进家门。</p>
<p>说不定他们要用这顶帽子变出一只兔子吧，哈利想入非非，大概就是这类事吧—— 他发现餐厅里的人都在盯着这顶帽子，于是他也盯着它。餐厅里鸦雀无声。接着，帽子扭动了。帽边裂开一道宽宽的缝，像一张嘴—— 帽子开始唱起来：<br>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<pre><code>Audio src：https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/breathing-room-reduces-stress/5367522.html
</code></pre>
<p>If you are feeling nervous or stressed, a simple thing can help. Take a deep breath.</p>
<p>Deep breathing can calm your nerves and lower the chemicals in your body that can lead to stress. If one of your friends is stressed, you can calmly tell them, “Try to take a deep breath.”</p>
<p>We sometimes describe these as deep cleansing breaths. A long, deep breath feels as if it is cleaning out your body.</p>
<p>American English has some expressions that use breath or breathing in them. One expression is breathing room. This may sound like a room used especially for breathing. But it is not.</p>
<p>“Breathing room” gives you time or space to do something, finish something or get relief from something.</p>
<p>It is what the online dictionary Merriam-Webster defines as a “buffer of time, space or money that allows for freedom of movement or relief from a given source of pressure or stress.”</p>
<p>So, time, space and money can all give us breathing room.</p>
<p>Time</p>
<p>First, here is an example related to time.</p>
<p>If you have a big work project or school project that is due in one month, you should start immediately if you can. This will give you some breathing room. If something goes wrong, you will have time to deal with it. Or if something fun comes up, like a party, you will have enough breathing room to be able to enjoy yourself.</p>
<p>If you wait until the very last minute to start your project, you have no breathing room. And that can cause you to feel very stressed.</p>
<p>Money</p>
<p>Now, let’s talk about how money can give you breathing room.</p>
<p>When a country experiences a recession or depression, people who live paycheck-to-paycheck may find themselves in a tough situation. Living paycheck-to-paycheck means you have little money in savings. You need your next paycheck to pay your bills.</p>
<p>However, if you have some money put aside, you might feel less stressed. For example, having enough money in the bank to pay six months of your rent, would give you some breathing room if the economy took a turn for the worse.</p>
<p>Space</p>
<p>Sometimes breathing room refers to actual space around you.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you witness a car crash. The driver struggles to get out of the car as people gather around to see if he is okay. You step in to make sure there is enough space between the injured driver and the crowd of people. “Step back! Step back! Give him some breathing room!” you shout.</p>
<p>Here is another example. Let’s say you must stay at home because of bad weather, or because of an illness, or because a new virus has turned into a pandemic and is forcing the world inside on a stay-at-home order!</p>
<p>You may find that after a few days -- or even weeks -- you need more breathing room. In other words, you feel like you need more space -- away from those you live with.</p>
<p>So, you can think of it this way: Breathing room reduces stress. It gives you the time, money or space to get something done or to just feel relaxed.</p>
