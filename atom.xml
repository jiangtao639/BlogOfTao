<p>
you have stolen it,right?
Good evening,Mrs Huber
It's all my fault that didn't hide the cup safely
If you're capable of arson,
obviously you are capable of breaking and entering
i don't know what you are talking about,Mrs HUber
i guess you destroyed it
Again, I don't know what you're talking about,
But,Yeah I did
I would keep the secret for you at the beginnig
But  you don't trust me
you really trouble a lot ,you know?
Susan,let's not be unpleasant!
we could be good friends as before/like  once we've always had

## 哈利波特 英译汉

### 翻译
<p>
  当魔术帽唱完歌后，整个大厅里掌声雷动。帽子哥向四个桌子的人鞠躬后，然后陷入寂静再次。
荣对哈利低语道，‘让我们试试那顶帽子吧
我会杀了fred，他要去跟巨魔战斗’
  哈利微微一笑。是的，带上这个帽子确实比念咒语强一百倍，但是他不想在众人面前尝试。看来这顶帽子的要求高了些。哈利觉得自己没有那份勇气和机灵劲儿或其他任何优点。如果帽子提出有一所专门让优柔寡断的人进的学-72 -院，那倒是对他最合适的地方。
这时麦格教授朝前走了几步，手里拿着一卷羊皮纸。
“我现在叫到谁的名字，谁就戴上帽子，坐到凳子上，昕候分院。”她说，“汉娜艾博!”
　一个面色红润、梳着两条金色发辫的小姑娘，跌跌撞撞地走出队列，戴上帽子，帽子刚好遮住她的限睛。她坐了下来。片刻停顿——“赫奇帕奇!”帽子喊道。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>People who believe in luck and bad luck -- that is to say, those considered superstitious – may think that some days or events are unlucky.</p>
<p>In the United States, Friday the 13 is known as an “unlucky” day by superstitious people. Another famously unlucky day for some is March 15, also known as, “The Ides of March.”</p>
<p>The Ides of March is so unlucky that it is often spoken as a warning: “Beware the Ides of March.”</p>
<p>First, what exactly is an “ides?” The Latin root of “ides,” a singular word, means “to divide.” So, the ides of any month falls in its middle. The Roman calendar set ides on the 15th in March, May, July and October or on the 13th in the other months. The ides of a month usually falls on the first day of a full moon.</p>
<p>In Roman times, the Ides of March was known as a date for paying off debts. But this connection was quickly lost because of different timing between calendar months and changes in the moon’s appearance. The Ides of March was also a time people celebrated Mars, the god of war.</p>
<p>But why do some people still use the expression, &quot;Beware of the Ides of March&quot;? Why do they consider it an unlucky day?</p>
<p>March 15 was very unlucky for one man a very long time ago. On that date in the year 44 BC Julius Caesar was killed.<br>
The British playwright William Shakespeare takes this incident from Roman history and freezes it forever in literature. In Act 1, Scene 2 of &quot;Julius And Brutus, Caesar’s loyal friend answers, “A soothsayer says to (bids you) beware the Ides of March.</p>
<p>Caesar does not listen to the warning. He should have. In Act III, Scene I, Shakespeare’s famous line seems to show that Caesar is asking for trouble.</p>
<p>Caesar says to the Soothsayer, “The Ides of March are come.”</p>
<p>The Soothsayer answers, “Aye, Caesar, but not gone.”</p>
<p>Caesar’s friend Brutus will be among the attackers who kill him on the Ides of March.</p>
<p>When he sees that Brutus has turned against him, he says, “Eh tu, Brutus?” This means “You too, Brutus?”</p>
<p>This expression is widely used in Western culture when someone is betrayed by a friend.Caesar,” Shakespeare writes about a meeting between the dictator and a “soothsayer,” someone who can predict the future.</p>
<p>“Beware the Ides of March,” says the soothsayer.</p>
<p>Caesar asks, “What man is that?”<br>
The Ides of March” is also the name of a U.S. film made in 2011. George Clooney directed the film. He also stars in it as a promising presidential candidate.</p>
<p>While no one gets assassinated, “The Ides of March” is a film abo________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Words in This Story<br>
beware – v. to be on guard; to take care of</p>
<p>aye – adv. yes; a word of confirmation</p>
<p>assassinate – v. to murder someone, often for political reasonsut a friend being disloyal to a friend in the world of politics. Often in politics, loyalty and friendship do not go hand-in-hand.</p>
<p>Julius Caesar learned this the hard way on the Ides of March.</p>

<p>In 1872, a Nebraska man named J. Sterling Morton proposed the first Arbor Day. It became a legal holiday in the state 13 years later.</p>
<p>Today many states observe Arbor Day on different dates throughout the year based on best planting times in their area. In North Dakota and Vermont, for example, Arbor Day is celebrated on the first Friday in May.</p>

<p>Trees do a lot for the environment. They clean the air around us. Some trees, such as apple and pear, give us fruit. Trees also provide shade for us and other creatures.</p>
<p>Some animals build their homes inside trees or on strong tree branches. People and animals can use the wood from trees for building materials.</p>
<p>You might find this strange, but trees can be fun to watch. You can just sit back and watch birds high up in the trees. If you live in an area with squirrels, watching them run up and around trees, jumping from one to the next can be a lot of fun.</p>

<p>In our expression today, “bark” means the sound a dog makes.</p>
<p>Dogs bark a lot. They bark when they want to go outside for a walk. They bark with they see other dogs. They bark when they chase other animals, such as cats and squirrels.</p>
<p>Now, imagine that a dog chases a squirrel up a tree. That is a lot of work – for the dog, that is. Dogs cannot climb trees. Squirrels, on the other hand, are expert climbers -- of trees and just about anything else. A squirrel may go up one tree but then jump to another. The dog simply can’t follow the squirrel. So, it stays on the ground barking and barking up the wrong tree.</p>
<p>And that is where we get our idiom.</p>

<!-- more -->
<p>For people, barking up the wrong tree means following a mistaken plan of action. If I bark up the wrong tree, I am doing something that will not get the result I want. I am wrong about the reason for something or possibly the way to get something.</p>
<p>For example, at a party I notice that my co-worker Jonas is interested in a good friend of mine named Ursula. But Ursula is happily married, which is bad news for Jonas. So, I say to him, “Jonas, I know you want to ask Ursula out on a date. But you are barking up the wrong tree! She is very happily married.”</p>
<p>Now, let me tell you about another person who used the wrong way to get something.</p>
<p>A friend of mine, Sharon, needed money for her new business idea. So, she went to an event to meet possible investors. However, the only people she met were other people looking for money. She spent the whole time barking up the wrong tree!</p>
<p>Now, keep this in mind when using this expression. While Americans do say “bark up the wrong tree,” we would not say “bark up the right tree.”</p>
<p>So, if you came to the VOA Learning English website to learn English, I would not say you are barking up the right tree. I would just say, “Welcome! You’ve come to the right place!”</p>
<p>Join us again next week when we explore words and expressions in American English.</p>
<p>Until next time … I’m Anna Matteo.</p>

Sometimes in life, you need to act quickly. Thinking too much about a problem does not always help. It can hold us back.
<p>We have expressions that describe this way of thinking.</p>
<p>“No time like the present.”<br>
“A rolling stone gathers no moss.”<br>
“Just do it!”<br>
But sometimes slower is better.</p>
<p>Many things in life require careful thought and preparation. Sometimes we need to be cautious and take precautions.</p>
<p>A great expression for that kind of behavior is, “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”</p>
<p>This saying comes to us from Benjamin Franklin. In addition to being a writer, Franklin was a printer, political thinker, politician, scientist, inventor and diplomat. He was also one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.</p>
<p>So, he was a busy man. But Franklin still found time to write and offer his advice to others. If he were alive today, he could probably make a good living as a life coach.</p>
<p>“An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,” is one of his most famous sayings. Now, Franklin lived during the 1700s, before the metric system took effect in Europe. The word ounce means something really small – just two one-hundredths of a kilogram to be exact.</p>
<p>So, his expression meant that, when dealing with a problem, spending a small amount of time and effort early on is a good investment. It can save you more trouble in the end.</p>
<p>For example, if a country announces strong measures for containing a virus, we could say, “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”</p>
<p>It is better to take severe precautions than to suffer severe consequences later.</p>
<p>Word historians say that when Franklin first used this expression, he was not talking about disease but rather fire prevention.</p>
<p>During a visit to Boston in 1733, Franklin was impressed with the city’s fire prevention methods. He tried to bring some of these practices to the city of Philadelphia, where he lived.</p>
<p>Supposedly, Franklin sent an unsigned letter to his own newspaper The Pennsylvania Gazette. Published on February 4, 1735, his letter -- “Protection of Towns from Fire” -- began with the expression “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” Then he wrote about how a city should prepare itself for a fire.</p>
<p>From protecting yourself against sickness to preventing a house fire, this expression can be used in serious situations. It is a fixed expression, meaning we don’t change the wording when we use it. We simply repeat it as is.</p>
<p>Let’s listen to this example:</p>
<p>How is the deal going with your real estate agent? Are you ready to buy your new house?</p>
<p>Just about. I have a few more questions about home insurance. So, I’m meeting with a financial advisor and an insurance agent this week.</p>
<p>They are sure to give you a lot of information. Do you really think it’s necessary?</p>
<p>An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If I get anything wrong, it will be difficult to fix later on. And it will cost more, too!</p>
<p>Didn’t you lose a lot of money on repairs to your house because it was under-insured?</p>
<p>Um … Good point. Let’s change the subject!</p>
<p>Now, another way to say this expression is “Better safe than sorry.” We use this one for many different situations – serious and not so serious.</p>
<p>Let's listen to this dialogue.</p>
<p>What a great day to be at the park! Thanks for the invite!</p>
<p>Sure thing. The weather is great! So, why did you bring an umbrella?</p>
<p>Well, the weather forecast said it could rain later today.</p>
<p>I heard that too. But look -- there’s not a cloud in the sky!</p>
<p>Oh, no! You cannot be serious!</p>
<p>Quick! Come under my umbrella! See. Better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>Okay, okay! Good point. Now, let’s get out of this rain.</p>
<p>Here it is better to say “better safe than sorry.” Benjamin Franklin’s advice would have sounded a little too serious.</p>
<p>And that’s the end of this Words and Their Stories!</p>
<p>The next time you want to take care and avoid problems down the road … use the expressions you heard here.</p>
<p>Until next time … I’m Anna Matteo!</p>

In human history, the spread of infectious diseases to mass numbers of people is not uncommon. Pandemics, historians say, started when we humans began farming land and living in communities. Pandemics increased as trade between communities and nations increased.</p>
<p>From smallpox to influenza to the plague, there was often no medical treatment to prevent or cure these diseases. Take for example, the plague that hit Europe in the 14th century. It is also known as the “Black Death.”</p>
<p>With no medical prevention available, isolating the sick was the only effective public health defense. With many other pandemics, the best chance at prevention was to keep sick people away from healthy people. This is called a quarantine.</p>
<p>And that is our word for today.</p>
<p>Word experts at Merriam-Webster explain that the word “quarantine” has both French and Italian influences.</p>
<p>In the late 1400s, English speakers borrowed the French word quarantaine which means “a period of about 40 days.” Quarante is the word for the number 40 (forty) in French.</p>
<p>At that time, quarantaine had a religious meaning. Some word experts say it refers to the period of time Jesus spent fasting -- going without food -- in the desert.</p>
<p>However, over time, people began using it for more than just religious situations. For example, it referred to the delay of putting a legal agreement in place. In the early 1500s, quarantine also was used to describe a &quot;period of 40 days in which a widow has the right to remain in her dead husband's house.”</p>
<p>Around the same time, other city-states in Europe were also using a similar word -- quarantena. This word was used to mean the “isolation of a ship to protect the port city from potential disease.”</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explains on its website that “quarantine was first introduced in 1377 on Croatia’s Dalmatian Coast.”</p>
<p>By the 1600s, English speakers began using quarantena to mean “isolation as protection from disease.” As the French form of this word (quarantaine) was already being used, English kept it but gave it a new meaning. It was now an English word based on French spelling -- with an Italian definition and Latin roots.</p>
<p>In North America in the late 1600s, quarantine was introduced to control yellow fever. The CDC says this was the case in New York (1688) and in Boston (1691).</p>
<p>That’s the word history. Now, let’s talk about how to use “quarantine” in a sentence.</p>
<p>For starters, it is both a noun and a verb.</p>
<p>As a noun, we often use it after the preposition “under.” If someone is under quarantine, they are required to physically keep away from others. For example: “When she was under quarantine, the woman learned how to play the piano and speak simple Russian.”</p>
<p>The word “quarantine” is often combined with other nouns. In the news and from government announcements you may read about, quarantine guidelines, quarantine authority and quarantine systems.</p>
<p>As a verb, we can say that some young people in the United States are not fully self-quarantining themselves.</p>
<p>So, isolation and quarantine are both ways to help protect the public. They both prevent exposure to people who have or may have a contagious disease.</p>
